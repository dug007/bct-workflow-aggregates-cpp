**Remark:** Visual Studio 2019 by default installs *Test Adapter for Google Test* (the MS clone based on GTA 0.10.1); if you want to continue using GTA, you need to manually install it. In that case, make sure to uninstall TAfGT (and other test adapters which might not be needed, see below), since neither can GTA and TAfGT be installed in parallel, nor does it make sense to do so.

Changes within this version:

* enhancement: option *Debugger engine* has new choice *Managed and native*, which allows to debug into managed code also ([#276](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/276))
* enhancement: [*settings helper files*](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter#settings_helper_files) allow to provide additional information to GTA at test discovery and execution time ([example project](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/tree/master/SampleTests/HelperFileTests)). This feature can be used to remove the need for a special configuration file for CI, or to reduce configuration redundancy between project and GTA settings ([#278](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/278))
* enhancement: speedup of test discovery. Hint: disabling or uninstalling unnecessary test adapters might also speed up test discovery ([#282](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/282))
* enhancement: new options allow better control of GTA output: output modes *None* and *Verbose* have been added, printing timestamp and/or severity can be disabled, output can be tagged with `[GTA]`, and summary of warnings and errors can be disabled ([#283](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/283))
* usability: reorganized options. Note that this potentially is a **breaking change**, since some XML options have been renamed; if your settings files happen to use these options, GTA will print a warning and tell you how to adjust them ([#271](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/271))
* donations: thanks to Pascal, Timothy, Jarred, Lin Chun, Anonymous, Юлиан, and the great company [GEOSLOPE](https://www.geoslope.com/) - I really appreciate it!
